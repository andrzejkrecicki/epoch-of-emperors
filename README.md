# Epoch of Emperors
Incoming Age of Empires clone written from scratch in pure* javascript (es6/es7)

\* - to be precise, first prototype was built with konva.js library although it was replaced by a faster, handcrafted solution, better suited for this project. See merge of [konva-removal](https://github.com/andrzejkrecicki/epoch-of-emperors/commit/050f47664fb566fc560c24deca03a7c37f63d434) branch for more info.
